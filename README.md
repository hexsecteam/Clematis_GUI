# Clematis - PE to Shellcode Converter

![HexSec Team Logo](images/hexsec_logo.png)


## What is Clematis?
Clematis is a sophisticated tool designed to transform PE (Portable Executable) files into position-independent shellcode. This conversion process enables the execution of PE files directly in memory, bypassing traditional file-based execution methods. The tool supports both x86 and x64 architectures and can handle various types of PE files, including executables (.exe) and dynamic link libraries (.dll).

### Key Capabilities
- Converts PE files to position-independent shellcode
- Supports both x86 and x64 architectures
- Handles various PE file types (EXE, DLL, .NET, Go)
- Integrates command-line arguments into the shellcode
- Provides obfuscation capabilities for enhanced stealth
- Implements LZNT1 compression for reduced shellcode size
- Ensures proper memory cleanup after execution

## Command Line Usage
The tool can be used through the command line with the following syntax:

```bash
python clematis.py -f <input_file> -o <output_file> [options]
```

### Required Arguments
- `-f, --file`: Path to the input PE file
- `-o, --output`: Path to save the output shellcode

### Optional Arguments
- `-g, --garble`: Enable obfuscation (default: True)
- `-c, --compress`: Enable compression (default: True)
- `-p, --parameter`: Execution parameters to pass to the PE file

### Example Usage
```bash
# Basic conversion
python clematis.py -f example.exe -o output.bin

# Conversion with parameters
python clematis.py -f example.exe -o output.bin -p arg1 arg2 "argument 3"

# Disable obfuscation and compression
python clematis.py -f example.exe -o output.bin -g false -c false
```

## Features
- Support for x86 and x64 architectures
- Command-line argument support
- Obfuscation for enhanced stealth
- LZNT1 compression algorithm
- Automatic memory cleanup
- Support for both executable files (.exe) and libraries (.dll)
- Support for .NET and Go applications

## GUI Version
The project now includes a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with PyQt5 that provides an intuitive way to use Clematis. The GUI includes:
- File selection fields with browse buttons for input PE file and output file
- Checkboxes for enabling/disabling obfuscation (-g) and compression (-c)
- Input field for execution parameters (-p)
- Real-time conversion status and output display
- Clear success/failure feedback
- Architecture detection (x86/x64)
- File size information

### GUI Features
- Input PE file selection
- Output file specification
- Obfuscation toggle (-g)
- Compression toggle (-c)
- Execution parameters input (-p)
- Detailed tooltips explaining each option
- Comprehensive help menu with program information
